# Used Car Price Prediction

This project is a complete data science pipeline that predicts the price of used cars based on various input features. It includes everything from data preprocessing and model training to deploying the model using a backend API and interacting with it through a React frontend.

---

## Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world used car data
- Handled missing values, outliers, and high-cardinality categorical features
- Applied One-Hot Encoding and frequency encoding
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** for high accuracy
- Exported the trained model using `joblib`
- Built a Flask backend for API serving
- Developed a React frontend to input car details and display predicted price
- Deployed the full-stack application
